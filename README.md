# Tier Nametags
### A Minecraft Fabric mod providing detailed in-game OceTiers statistics.
Tier Nametags is a small project built in under two weeks with the ultimate goal of providing aesthetically pleasing tier information to OceTiers players. Tier Nametags offers customisable display names and aims to allow players to quickly search and check OceTiers statistics without interrupting gameplay or performance.
